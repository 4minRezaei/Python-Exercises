'''
Suppose that you have a list x = [1,3, 5, 0, -1, 3, -2],
and you need to remove all negative numbers from that list.
Write the code to do this.
'''
x = [1, 3, 5, 0, -1, 3, -9]
for index, val in enumerate(x):
    if val < 0:
        del x[index]
print(x)


'''
How would you count the total number of negative numbers
in a list y = [[1, -1, 0], [2, 5, -9], [-2, -3, 0]] ?
'''

y = [[1, -1, 0], [2, 5, -9], [-2, -3, 0]]
sum = 0
for i in y:
    for j in i:
        if j < 0:
            sum += j
print(sum)


'''
What code would you use to print
very low if the value of x is below -5,
low if it's from -5 up to 0,
neutral if it's equal to 0,
high if it's greater than 0 up to 5,
and very high if it's greater than 5 ?
'''
ls = [1, 3, 5, 0, -1, 3, -9, 9]
for i in ls:
    if i < -5:
        print('very low')
    elif -5 <= i < 0:
        print('low')
    elif i == 0:
        print('neutral')
    elif 0 < i <= 5:
        print('high')
    else:
        print('very high')
